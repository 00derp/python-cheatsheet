## About Python Cheat Sheet

Basic cheatsheet for Python mostly based on the book written by Al Sweigart, [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) under the [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) and many other sources.

> Anyone can forget how to make character classes for a regex. Sometimes I even forget how to slice a list or do a for loop. This cheatsheet tries to provide a basic reference for beginner and advanced python developers. We want to lower the entry barrier for newcomers and help seasoned veterans pick up new tricks and remember old ones.
